ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

This is my vimrc file. I clone it to my computer and then link to the directory
from ~/.vim. It has a few options that work against RSI. Also check out my
[us_split project on github](https://github.com/cheater/us_split_v3) for a
keyboard layout that minimizes RSI.


INSTALLATION

```bash
# Install vimrc
if ! [ -d ~/projects/vimrc ]; then
  echo "Cloning vimrc..."
  mkdir -p ~/projects
  cd ~/projects
  # can't use git@github.com:cheater/vimrc.git if no ssh key has been installed yet
  git clone https://github.com/cheater/vimrc.git
  fi
if ! [ -e ~/.vim ]; then
  echo "Installing vimrc..."
  ln -s ~/projects/vimrc ~/.vim
  fi
if ! [ -d ~/projects/vimrc/plugged ]; then
  echo "Installing Vim plugins..."
  if ! vim +PlugInstall +qa; then
    rm -rf ~/projects/vimrc/plugged
    echo "Error installing Vim plugins!" >&2
    exit 1
    fi
  fi
