. consider configuring ctags for python
. regenerate ctags/cscope when a file is saved
. make LongLinesHide work on Vim with colorcolumn
. make "bad spaces" on empty lines (the line is only made out of spaces) not
  show up or show up as a less annoying color - however, those are not in the
  vimrc file.. they might be coming from the filetype plugin?
. make a cmd to generate ctags and cscope
. display number of search matches somewhere (status bar? command line?)
. check out solarized, zenburn color schemes
. on line continuations, use an underlined style on the first character instead
  of the "↪ " chars, because that breaks copying from the window
. make horizontal tabs show up with a different colour (gray?) rather than
  using the "▸" char, because that breaks copying from the window
