. consider configuring ctags for python
. regenerate ctags/cscope when a file is saved
. make LongLinesHide work on Vim with colorcolumn
. make "bad spaces" on empty lines (the line is only made out of spaces) not
  show up or show up as a less annoying color - however, those are not in the
  vimrc file.. they might be coming from the filetype plugin?
. make a cmd to generate ctags and cscope
. display number of search matches somewhere (status bar? command line?)
. check out solarized, zenburn color schemes
. on line continuations, use an underlined style on the first character instead
  of the "↪ " chars, because that breaks copying from the window
. make horizontal tabs show up with a different colour (gray?) rather than
  using the "▸" char, because that breaks copying from the window

12:37 <MarcWeber> vim-addon-actions (bind run interpreter actions to buf write
or key hit events)

12:40 <MarcWeber> Either jump into "aurum", have a look at vim-addon-views
which is used by my minmial git support plugin or contact fugitive maintainers

12:41 <MarcWeber> and vim-addon-goto-thing-at-cursor provides a way to register
functions making some sense of context suggesting jump to lactions

12:43 <MarcWeber> cheater If you are using X give vim-addon-async a try. It
only requires a C compiler for the helper application, no ruby setup, nothing
else.

try finding a plugin which displays hg/git annotate on the left of a buffer. if
you can't find it try using :vcsannotate from vcscommand.
